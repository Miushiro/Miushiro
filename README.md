I first come into contact with coding is when i was 14, where i just started to play Warcraft 3 (Yes i know it is very old) and get intrigued at how game modes, maps were formed.
Now been playinmg with codes and 3d graphics for on-off 11 years.
I understand that there is still a lot i don't know about, so tell me so i can learn more!


If need anything can onnect to me via my Linkedin or my GitHub, or even mail me if need anything, will be glad to be of help!
